# Motion-Detection-in-MATLAB
Motion detection is the process of detecting a change in the position of an object relative to its
surroundings or a change in the surroundings relative to an object. Motion detection can be achieved by
either mechanical or electronic methods.] When motion detection is accomplished by natural
organisms, it is called motion perception.
Motion Detection in MATLAB. In this project, I am gonna detect the motion in MATLAB. This project was
designed for security purposes and the condition was to use MATLAB instead of PIR Sensor. We all know
that PIR sensor is used for motion detection but for that we have to design a hardware but using this
software we can easily detect any motion using MATLAB.
In this project, I have used the webcam and then applied a simple image processing algorithm, designed
in MATLAB. Using this algorithm I have detected the motion in the environment
